## Pre-Analysis Step: Discover Project Standards

Before analyzing code, ensure project-specific standards are loaded:
1. Use the `load_appverk_skill` tool with name "standards-discovery"
2. Follow the discovery workflow to locate CONTRIBUTING.md, CODING_STANDARDS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/*.md, and similar files
3. Apply discovered standards as additional review criteria throughout your analysis

If no explicit standards are found, proceed with industry best practices and note the absence in your report.

# Analyze PR Feedback

You analyze comments from a GitHub Pull Request, classify each comment's validity, and generate a report with draft responses for feedback that should be rejected.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - optional PR number and flags

**Parsing:**

- No argument → detect PR from current branch
- Number (e.g., `123`) → use as PR number
- `--include-conversation` → include general PR comments (not just review comments)

---

## Phase 1: Identify PR

### Step 1.1: Parse arguments

```
Input: $ARGUMENTS
```

Extract:

- PR number (if provided)
- `--include-conversation` flag (true/false)

### Step 1.2: Detect PR (if no number provided)

If no PR number in arguments:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,author,url --jq '.number'
```

**If command fails:** Report error:

> "No PR found for current branch. Provide PR number: `/analyze-feedback 123`"

### Step 1.3: Validate PR exists

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json number,title,author,url,state
```

**If PR not found:** Report error:

> "PR #<NUMBER> not found in this repository."

**If PR closed/merged:** Continue but note in report.

### Step 1.4: Store PR metadata

Extract and store:

- `pr_number`
- `pr_title`
- `pr_author`
- `pr_url`
- `pr_state`

---

## Phase 2: Fetch Comments

### Step 2.1: Get repository info

```bash
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"'
```

Store as `owner/repo`.

### Step 2.2: Fetch review comments (always)

```bash
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments --jq '.[] | {id, author: .user.login, body, path, line: .original_line, created_at, in_reply_to_id}'
```

Review comments are attached to specific lines of code.

### Step 2.3: Fetch conversation comments (if --include-conversation)

```bash
gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments --jq '.[] | {id, author: .user.login, body, created_at}'
```

Conversation comments are general discussion, not line-specific.

### Step 2.4: Filter comments

**Exclude:**

- Comments by PR author (they don't review their own code)
- Bot comments (author contains `[bot]` or known bot names)
- Empty comments or emoji-only (body matches `^[\s\p{Emoji}]*$`)
- Already resolved comments (if detectable)

**For each remaining comment, store:**

- `id` - for replying later
- `author` - reviewer username
- `body` - comment text
- `path` - file path (review comments only)
- `line` - line number (review comments only)
- `type` - "review" or "conversation"

### Step 2.5: Handle edge cases

**No comments after filtering:**

> "PR #123 has no review comments to analyze."

**Only conversation comments (no review comments):**

> "PR #123 has no review comments. Use `--include-conversation` to analyze general comments."

---

## Phase 3: Gather Context

### Step 3.1: Get PR diff

```bash
gh pr diff {pr_number}
```

Store full diff for reference.

### Step 3.2: Read changed files

For each unique file path in review comments:

1. Use Read tool to get current file content
2. Focus on areas around commented lines (±30 lines)

### Step 3.3: Read related files

For each changed file, check for:

- Imported modules → Read if local
- Test files → `tests/**/test_<filename>.py` or `**/<filename>.test.ts`
- Type definitions → `.d.ts` files, `types.py`

Use Glob to find, Read to examine.

### Step 3.4: Gather project documentation

Search for and read (if exist):

**Root level:**

- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Docs directory:**

```bash
ls docs/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No docs directory"
```

Read relevant documentation files.

### Step 3.5: Get commit history

For each commented file:

```bash
git log --oneline -20 -- <file_path>
```

### Step 3.6: Check previous PRs (optional, for complex cases)

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --limit 5 --search "<filename>"
```

---

## Phase 4: Analyze Comments

### Step 4.1: Prepare context bundle

For each comment, create a context bundle:

```
Comment:
- Author: @{author}
- File: {path}:{line}
- Body: "{body}"

Code Context:
{relevant code snippet ±30 lines around commented line}

Project Standards:
{extracted coding standards if found}

File History:
{recent commits touching this file}
```

### Step 4.2: Launch feedback-analyzer agent

For each comment, use Task tool:

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "feedback-analyzer"
- prompt: <context bundle from Step 4.1>
- run_in_background: false (analyze sequentially for consistency)
```

### Step 4.3: Collect results

For each comment, store the agent's response:

- `classification` - "Address" or "Reject"
- `reasoning` - explanation
- `draft_response` - if classified as "Reject"

### Step 4.4: Group results

Separate into two lists:

- `to_address` - comments classified as "Address"
- `to_reject` - comments classified as "Reject" (with draft responses)

---

## Phase 5: Generate Report

Present the analysis in this exact format:

~~~markdown
## Feedback Analysis: PR #{pr_number} - "{pr_title}"

**Repository:** {owner}/{repo}
**PR Author:** @{pr_author}
**Comments analyzed:** {total} ({review_count} review, {conversation_count} conversation)

---

### ✅ To Address ({count})

#### 1. @{author} in `{path}:{line}`
> "{comment body - first 200 chars}..."

**Reasoning:** {reasoning from agent}

---

[repeat for each "Address" comment]

---

### ❌ To Reject ({count})

#### 1. @{author} in `{path}:{line}`
> "{comment body - first 200 chars}..."

**Reasoning:** {reasoning from agent}

**Draft response:**
> {draft_response from agent}

---

[repeat for each "Reject" comment]

---

### Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| ✅ To Address | {address_count} |
| ❌ To Reject | {reject_count} |

---

**Publish responses? (all / selected / none)**
~~~

---

## Phase 6: Publish Responses (Optional)

### Step 6.1: Wait for user choice

After presenting the report, ask the user with the `question` tool:

- `all` → publish all draft responses
- `select` → interactive selection
- `none` → skip publishing

### Step 6.2: Handle "select"

If the user chooses "select", present numbered list of drafts using the `question` tool:

```
1. @reviewer in `src/utils.py:28` - "A function is the right choice here..."
2. @reviewer in `src/api.py:55` - "This case is already handled..."
3. @reviewer in `src/models.py:12` - "Validation happens upstream..."

Which to publish? (e.g. 1,3 or 1-3 or "all" / "cancel")
```

Parse user input:

- `1,3` → publish items 1 and 3
- `1-3` → publish items 1, 2, and 3
- `all` → publish all
- `cancel` → cancel, don't publish any

### Step 6.3: Publish to GitHub

For each selected draft:

```bash
gh api --method POST \
  /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="{draft_response}"
```

**On success:** Note published.

**On failure:** Report error, continue with remaining.

### Step 6.4: Report publication results

```
Published: 2 of 3 responses
- ✅ @reviewer in `src/utils.py:28`
- ✅ @reviewer in `src/api.py:55`
- ❌ @reviewer in `src/models.py:12` - error: [error message]
```

## Error Handling

### GitHub CLI Errors

| Error | Detection | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Not logged in | `gh auth status` fails | "Log in to GitHub: `gh auth login`" |
| No repo context | `gh repo view` fails | "Run this command in a git repository directory" |
| Rate limited | 403 with rate limit message | "API rate limit exceeded. Try again in {reset_time}." |
| No permissions | 403/404 on PR | "No access to PR #{number}. Check your permissions." |

### Edge Cases

| Situation | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| PR has 0 comments | Report: "PR #{n} has no comments to analyze." |
| All comments from PR author | Report: "All comments are from the PR author." |
| Comment already has reply from user | Skip, note in report: "(already replied)" |
| Very long comment (>2000 chars) | Truncate in report, full text to agent |

### Recovery

If publication partially fails:

- Complete publishing remaining items
- Report failures at end
- Suggest retry command for failed items
